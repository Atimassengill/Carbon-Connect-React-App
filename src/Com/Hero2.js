                        Climate change is the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place. 
                        Climate change could refer to a particular location or the planet as a whole. Climate change may 
                        cause weather patterns to be less predictable. These unexpected weather patterns can make it 
                        difficult to maintain and grow crops in regions that rely on farming because expected temperature 
                        and rainfall levels can no longer be relied on. Climate change has also been connected with other 
                        damaging weather events such as more frequent and more intense hurricanes, floods, downpours, and 
                        winter storms. In polar regions, the warming global temperatures associated with climate change have 
                        meant ice sheets and glaciers are melting at an accelerated rate from season to season. This contributes 
                        to sea levels rising in different regions of the planet. Together with expanding ocean waters due to rising 
                        temperatures, the resulting rise in sea level has begun to damage coastlines as a result of increased flooding 
                        and erosion. The cause of current climate change is largely human activity, like burning fossil fuels, like natural 
                        gas, oil, and coal. Burning these materials releases what are called greenhouse gases into Earth’s atmosphere. There, 
                        these gases trap heat from the sun’s rays inside the atmosphere causing Earth’s average temperature to rise. This rise 
                        in the planet's temperature is called global warming. The warming of the planet impacts local and regional climates. 
                        Throughout Earth's history, climate has continually changed. When occuring naturally, this is a slow process that has 
                        taken place over hundreds and thousands of years. The human influenced climate change that is happening now is occuring at 
                        a much faster rate
